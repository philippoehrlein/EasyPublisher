# The `content/info` folder

The content/info folder lets you control key parts of your website – using simple text files.
There’s no interface, no database – just plain files with a few special lines that define how your site behaves.

All files are optional. If you don’t need them, just delete them – or the whole folder. easyPublisher will still work just fine.

## Available files and what they do
### `config.txt`

Set basic global settings for your site. For now, only two options exist:
```
@suffix txt  
@lang en
```
- `@suffix` defines the file extension you use for content files (e.g. `.txt` or `.md`)
- `@lang` sets the language code for your website (e.g. `en`, `de`, ...)

### `index.txt`

Overrides the default homepage.  
If you want full control over your landing page, just write your own `index.txt`.

---

### `meta.txt`

Controls meta information for your website (SEO + structure) and the navigation.  

Basic example:
```
# Site Title  
@author Your Name  
@authorurl https://example.com  
@description Description for Search Engines about 160 characters
@keywords this, helps, search engines

## TOC
[[ filename ]]
[[ 01-filename ]]
@author Overrides the global Authors Name for 01-filename
@description Overides the global description for 01-filename
[[ 02-filename ]]
@keywords overrides, global keywords, for, 02-filename

```

What it does:
- The `#` heading is used as your website title
- The `@` lines below are used for meta tags and schema data
- The `## TOC` section defines your navigation and allows descriptions for each page

---

### `contact.txt`, `imprint.txt`, `privacy.txt`

These files create optional legal or information pages:
- `contact.txt` → contact page
- `imprint.txt` → imprint/legal info
- `privacy.txt` → privacy policy

Add them if you need them – they will be added automatically to the core footer.

---

### `404.txt`

Customize the “Page not found” message.  
If missing, a default message will be shown.
