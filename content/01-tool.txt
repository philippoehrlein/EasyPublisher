# What Makes a Good Digital Tool?

A good tool doesn’t feel like technology.

It stays out of your way.  
It supports the idea, not the process.  
It doesn’t ask for logins, options, or licenses — it's just there.

easyPublisher tries to do just that:  
Make publishing simple, not build another platform.
