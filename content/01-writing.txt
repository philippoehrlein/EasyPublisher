# Writing with Markdown

easyPublisher is built around clean and simple writing — using plain text in Markdown[^Markdown is a markup language created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).] format.  
It works best with [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), but any Markdown editor will do.

## Supported syntax

Everything that iA Writer supports will work out of the box.

### Headings
Use `#` to define headings. The more `#`, the deeper the level (like sections and subsections). Keep a logical order.

```
# Heading 1  
## Heading 2  
### Heading 3  
#### Heading 4  
##### Heading 5  
###### Heading 6  
```

### Text formatting
You can highlight, bold, italicize or strike through text:

```
==Highlight==  
**Bold**, *Italic*, ~~Strikethrough~~
```

### Lists
Lists start with a dash. You can nest them for sublists — perfect for multi-level ideas or outlines.

```
- List item
- List item  
    - Sub item
    - Sub item
```

### WikiLinks
Internal links use double brackets. You can optionally set a label:

```
[[filename]]  
[[filename|Custom Label]]
```

### Horizontal line
Use three dashes to insert a visual separator between sections.

```
---
```

### Code blocks
Wrap code with triple backticks. It will be shown exactly as written.

```
<html></html>
```

### Images
Just place the image file in the content/ folder and write its filename:

```
my-image.jpg
```

External images also work:
```
![](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

### Footnotes
Write inline footnotes like in iA Writer. They are numbered automatically:

```
This is a sentence with a footnote.[^ Example footnote text]
```

### Tables
Use simple Markdown tables to organize information:

```
| Column A | Column B |
|:--|:--|
| Example | Example |
| Example | Example |
```
