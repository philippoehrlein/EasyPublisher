# How to Use easyPublisher

## Step 1: Write

Use any Markdown editor you like — for example, iA Writer or Typora.

Keep writing as usual. There's no need to export or format anything.

## Step 2: Sync

Just sync your writing project with the `/content` folder in easyPublisher.  
This can be done with a folder sync tool, cloud service, or symbolic link.

## Step 3: View

Open easyPublisher in your browser. Your synced texts appear instantly — no rebuilds, no configuration.
